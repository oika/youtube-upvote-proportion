## What's this

A chrome extension to display the percentage of high ratings to the number of views.

Lately, YouTube has been hiding the number of low ratings, but we want to know whether a video is good or not before we watch it.  
This extension will show the percentage of high ratings to the number of views on the video list pages.  
You can use this to some extent to decide whether you want to watch the video or not.

## Chrome Web Store
